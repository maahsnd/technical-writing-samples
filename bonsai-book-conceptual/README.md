The content included in this folder was researched and written by me. My purpose in 
creating it was to provide an overview and simple user guide for my Bonsai Book application, which I developed as a personal project along with my collaborators.
Notably, this application is in the early stages of development, and still does 
not represent a fully functional product. That is to say, at time of writing some
of the features I discuss are not yet implemented. The documentation is addressed 
primarily to potential users of the product, but also serves as a conceptual
overview for developers who may be interested in contributing to the project.

This folder contains the following files:

- `bonsai-book-overview.md`: An overview of the Bonsai Book application, including a description of the project, its purpose, and its features.

- `About.tsx`: A React component that renders the markdown for the site's About page, 
and dynamically creates an interactive table of contents for the page.
