The content included in this folder was researched and written by me. My purpose in 
creating it was to A: provide a set of instructions which, when followed, allow a user to create an image gallery component in React, and B: in doing so, illustrate a conceptual framework that is sufficiently generic to be applied and adapted to a wide variety of use
cases. 

Notably, the component created by this procedure is minimal in terms of its features and styling. It is intended to be a starting point for developers who wish to create a more complex and fully-featured image gallery component. Furthermore, it is dependent on both its prerequisites and its parent component for its functionality. Its intended audience is developers who are familiar with React and JavaScript, but who may not have experience creating image gallery components.

This folder contains the following file:

- `react-image-gallery-walkthrough.md`: A step-based procedure that explains how to create
an image gallery component in React and JavaScript.
